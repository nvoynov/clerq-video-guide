# Foreword

In this short video course, I want to introduce you to my new Ruby gem called `Clerq`. It is the third implementation of the idea to hold user and software requirements in separated markdown files. Started from the requirements management perspective it becomes rather a general tool for managing thick documents. And it seems to a suitable solution to the problem for many people who do some kind of technical writing.

It worth be mentioned that this whole document also is developing with Clerq. You can find its sources at [github.com/nvoynov/clerq-video-guide](https://github.com/nvoynov/clerq-video-guide) and get the latest version of the document at [bin/Clerq Video Guide.pdf](https://github.com/nvoynov/clerq-video-guide/bin/Clerq%20Video%20Guide).

## Purpose

The purpose of this document is to provide scripts for the "Clerq User Guide (Youtube)[]". The document provides additional information for the set of video lessons, provides links, and summarizes the knowledge gained.

Recommended reading for all people who write thick structured documents especially in the area of software development.

## References

The main subject of this document is using the [Clerq](https://github.com/nvoynov/clerq) ruby gem.

## Overview

The following sections of the document contain four lessons that introduce one with different aspects of using the Clerq.

The first chapter [[l1]] introduces into using basic command-line interface and managing nodes hierarchy through nodes metadata.

The second [Metadata and Templates]() provides information on how to prepare a project for writing big structured documents.

The followed chapter [Scripting and Automation]() shows you how to develop quality rules for your projects and how to publish documents in different formats through `Pandoc`.

The last chapter [Advanced scripting]() provides a few examples of developing quality rules for two or more related projects where the second project depends on the first one.
